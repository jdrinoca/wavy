Wavy is a simple audio visualizer written using PyAudio.

Running this script requires:

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/#)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

Included in this repository is a distributable folder (dist) with an executable of wavy.  Once downloaded, open the dist folder and launch 'wavy.exe'.  The executable can be run without having to install any of the aforementioned python packages.

Additionally, the usage of this script (and executable) requires stereo mix to be enabled.  Instructions on how to enable stereo mix for Windows 10 can be found [here](https://thegeekpage.com/stereo-mix/#:~:text=Method%2D1%20Enable%20Stereo%20Mix%20from%20Sounds%2D&text=Press%20Windows%20key%2BR%20to%20open%20Run%20window.&text=Then%2C%20right%2Dclick%20on%20%E2%80%9C,the%20'Stereo%20Mix'%20option.).

## Enjoy!
